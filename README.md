#**How To Use The Calculator**

##*First Step!*
First, it will ask you what kind of operation that you would like to use. 
There are five options: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, percentage, and exponential.
(if you input any other operation, it will tell you that you have inputed a invalid operation)

##*Second Step* 
After you have inputed your desired operation, it will ask you to insert 2 or 3 numbers depending on the operation you choose. 
  For example, for addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, it will allow you to insert up to 3 numbers. 
  
  ##*Third step*
  Once you have entered all of your desired values, it will calculate your numbers based on the operation you have selected. 
  If you choose addition, it will add the inputed values.
  if you choose subtraction, it will subtract the inputed values.
  If you chose multiplication, it will multiply the inputed values.
  If you choose division, it will divide the inputed values.
  If you choose percentage, it will multiply the two values then divide them by 100 to find the percentage.
  If you choose exponential, it will raise your initial number to the power of your second value.
  
  ##The End!
